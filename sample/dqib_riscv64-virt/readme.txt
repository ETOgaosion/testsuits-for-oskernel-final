You need to install packages opensbi and u-boot-qemu
(Try to) boot with:
qemu-system-riscv64 -machine virt -cpu rv64 -m 1G -device virtio-blk-device,drive=hd -drive file=image.qcow2,if=none,id=hd -device virtio-net-device,netdev=net -netdev user,id=net,hostfwd=tcp::2222-:22 -bios /usr/lib/riscv64-linux-gnu/opensbi/generic/fw_jump.elf -kernel /usr/lib/u-boot/qemu-riscv64_smode/uboot.elf -object rng-random,filename=/dev/urandom,id=rng -device virtio-rng-device,rng=rng -nographic -append "root=LABEL=rootfs console=ttyS0"
You can use Ctrl-a x to exit from QEMU.
You can login with root:root or debian:debian, or using the identities ssh_user_*_key in this directory.
You can also login with SSH on the local port 2222 (this will give you a much better terminal emulation than the QEMU default).
Some machines support a video interface, which you can enable removing the -nographic option and possibly also the console= kernel argument.
